# Spark-websocket-chat

## About

Chat app created using the light-weight microservice framework "Spark Java". It internally uses Jetty server and it's WebSocket capability

This application can support more than concurrent 500 users, with full privacy chatting experience (as we don't log or store any message :D)

I have also set up a complete pipeline setup to deploy code to Heroku free tier VM's.

**Give a try with working demo of chat group** : https://websocket-spark-chat.herokuapp.com/

## Want to run your own instance ?

_Prerequisite_ : Make sure you have Java 8+ and Maven installed. 

1. Clone this repo https://github.com/ayushsoni1/spark-websocket-chat.git
2. Open file websocket.js and change Websocket connection from wss to ws in Line 1 (If you do not have localhost https cert configured)
3. Open Terminal and build using Maven (mvn clean install Or mvn clean package)
4. After the build, you should have a target folder with a file as `websocketchat...-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
5. Navigate to this path and run `java -jar websocketchat-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
6. The server will start default on `localhost:4567`. Open it in browser and Enjoy! :)  

## Screenshots of deployed app
Typically strong in backend code, but could build decent responsive UI (with the help of a tremendous strategic partnership with google:D)
