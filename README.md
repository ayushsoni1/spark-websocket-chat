# Spark-websocket-chat
Chat app create using light-weight microservice framework "Spark Java". It internally uses Jetty server and it's websocket capability

This application can support more than concurrent 500 users, with full privacy chatting experience (as we don't log or store any message :D)

I have also set up a complete pipeline setup to deploy code to Heroku free tier VM's.
Give a try with live chat group : https://websocket-spark-chat.herokuapp.com/
